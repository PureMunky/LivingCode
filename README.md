Living Code
===========

# Purpose

Pushing code to production can be a pain even with continuous integration and delivery. This framework is meant to be an AMD compatible module framework that automatically handles live code updates, runs tests, and determines if code is ready for "prime-time".

# Disclaimer

I have no idea if this will even work but I want to try it out conceptually.
